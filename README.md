## Simulate set of tasks using SimSo

## Simulation 1 

Input the tasks T1(2, 0.5), T2(3, 1.2), T3(6, 0.5) and the RM scheduler into the SimSo simulator

-Use SimSo to schedule the task set

Provide a report answering the following questions:

What is the utilization factor of the system and what is the value for Urm(3)
What is the minimum/maximum/average response time of all tasks?
Is any task missing the deadline? Which task? Where?
If a deadline is missed, could it be avoided by changing the scheduler
